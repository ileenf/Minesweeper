# Minesweeper

## Overview
Inspired by coding an assembly version of Minesweeper using MIPS assembly for Intro to Computer Organization, I recreated Python version.

### Key Features
* ~10 bombs generated for a default 10x10 board
* Shows exploding bomb when player reveals a bomb
* Catches user error when making an invalid move
* Board display is simple and easily to read/use
* Implemented algorithm that reveals adjacent cells when revealing a cell with no bomb or adjacent bombs
* Counter that displays number of bombs left to flag
